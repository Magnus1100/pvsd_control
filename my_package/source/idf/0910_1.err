   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=SITE 1
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=SHENZHEN - CHN SWERA WMO#=594930
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[22.55] degrees, Longitude difference=[114.10] degrees.

   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS OFF DISCRETE", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=FLOOR_9516AE38
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 12 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many figures [>15000]  detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a plant sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Plant object input. SimulationControl Plant Sizing option ignored.

   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** IDF file contains object "ExternalInterface:Variable",
   **   ~~~   ** but object "ExternalInterface" with appropriate key entry is not specified. Values will not be updated.
   ** Severe  ** ExternalInterface: Did not find file "socket.cfg".
   **   ~~~   ** This file needs to be in same directory as in.idf.
   **   ~~~   ** Check the documentation for the ExternalInterface.
   **  Fatal  ** Error in ExternalInterface: Check EnergyPlus *.err file.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
